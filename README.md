To keep up with recent updates, reading article is a must.

Recent advancement in tech especially in AI fields makes it hard to keep up with all of these massive amount of articles/ blogs.

# This project aims to leverage the power of llm agents to help me being up to date.

It is important to note that I encourage readings and you need to read a lot of article. This summariser would not be enough if you want to further expands your arsenal as an AI engineer/ practitioner.

# The outline of this project is as below:

## Aim:

1. Leverage agentic architecture in this project as part of personal learning path.
2. Make autonomous agent that is capable to receive link and make a websearch.
3. Perceive/ Process all the content in the webpage and parse it into a summariser.
4. Run the system only in terminal

## Possible Refinement:

1. Parse adds.
2. Make another agent to help in breaking down knowledge obtain. (Easy to understand output)
3. Make other agent to help make websearch and retrieve related source for more compact and quality output

## Update

### 28-3-2025

#### Planning

- Use Gemini as its provide generous free API calls. ✔️
- Use Langchain for ease of implementation. ✔️
- The programme will only run in terminal (removed overthinking for UI). ✔️
- Make a basic chat program ✔️

#### Notes

- Could use chat template but will ignore for now
- Could check other model in huggingface and use huggingface interface for more robust model for our usecase.
